# Vending-Machine-System
Assembly Language Project
"Our team embarked on a project to create a vending machine system using Assembly language, applying the knowledge we've acquired throughout our course. We named our system 'Stabak Vending Machine.'

This endeavor involved designing a user interface, defining the products and their corresponding prices, implementing payment handling, enabling product selection and dispensing, providing informative messages to users, and managing the inventory to prevent sales when items were out of stock. This project not only posed challenges but also allowed us to put our learning into practice effectively."
